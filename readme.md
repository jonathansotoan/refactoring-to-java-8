# Description
This repository aims to show a way of refactoring a project from Java 7 to Java 8 using the following new features:
- Lambda expressions
- Streams
- Method references

## Note
The method `DefaultSeatRecommendationsService.recommendSeats` is over-engineered in all its history points, it should
not be taken as an example of good practices
